# pathFinding
Pathfinding is a simple python project that helps you visualize the A* path algorithm on how to find the shortest path between two points or nodes


## How to run pathfinding application locally in your machine. 
1. Either fork or clone the application
2. Open and navigate through the folder where the requirements.txt is located and install the dependencies 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
3. And finally run the main.py file and choose the start and end point
4. Make yourself some barriers by left clicking and dragging 
5. if you want to delete a barrier just right click on the barriers you want to remove
6. Just hit space and let see how to the algorithm works.

## Features
- Ability to choose an start and and end point from anywhere in the window
- draw your maze or barriers the way to want to.
- remove them anytime your feel changing the structure of the maze
- move the starting and the end point before running the algorithm 


## Future futures
- Add an comparaison between 2 path finding algorithms
- Improve the gui
- Add some instruction for the application to be more user friendly


## Dependencies
  - Pygame
